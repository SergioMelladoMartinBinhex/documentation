Connect a measurement tool
==========================

With Odoo's :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` Box, it is possible to connect measurement tools to the
Odoo database. Find the list of supported devices here: `Supported devices
<https://www.odoo.com/page/iot-hardware>`__

Connect with Universal Serial Bus (USB)
=======================================

To add a device connected by :abbr:`USB (Universal Serial Bus)`, just plug the :abbr:`USB (Universal
Serial Bus)` cable in the *IoT Box*, and the device should appear in the Odoo database.

Connect in Bluetooth
====================

Activate the Bluetooth on the device (see the device manual for further explanation) and the IoT
Box will automatically try to connect to the device.

Here is an example of what it should look like:

Link a measurement tool to a quality control point within a manufacturing process
=================================================================================

In the :menuselection:`Quality` app, a device can be set up on a *Quality Control Point*. Go to the
:menuselection:`Control Points --> Quality Control` and open the control point which will be linked
with the measurement tool.

Now, edit the control point and choose the device from the dropdown list. The changes will
automatically save when navigating away from the page with the changes.

Now, the measurement tool is linked to the chosen *Control Point*. The value, which usually needs to
be changed manually, will be automatically updated while the tool is being used.
